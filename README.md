  Build the ionic project now, you will not get any error at this point. But the app won'r work as expected. You should modify the `application` part of  `AndroidManifest.xml` file to get it worked as expected. You should add **`android:name="com.vidyo.vidyosample.app.ApplicationJni"`**
  
  Replace  
  `<application android:hardwareAccelerated="true" android:icon="@drawable/icon" android:label="@string/app_name">`  
  into  
  `<application android:hardwareAccelerated="true" android:icon="@drawable/icon" android:label="@string/app_name" android:name="com.vidyo.vidyosample.app.ApplicationJni">`

		function(results) {  
		}, function (error) {  
			alert("Error: " + error);  
		}  
	);`
